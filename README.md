Steps Of Project:-

Steps:-

1. Load the Data
Objective: Read the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Action: Use pandas to load the CSV file containing the Titanic data.

2. Data Cleaning
Objective: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and other inconsistencies to prepare the data for analysis.
Actions:
Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
Fill missing values where appropriate.
Drop rows or columns with excessive missing values if necessary.
Incorrect Data Types: Ensure all columns have appropriate data types.
Convert categorical variables to the correct data type.
Convert numerical variables to the correct data type.
Outliers: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Explore the dataset to understand relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends.
Actions:
Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
Use describe() [your choice]for numerical columns.
Use value_counts()[your choice] for categorical columns.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations to explore the data.
Survival Rate: Plot the overall survival rate.
Survival by Class: Plot survival rates by passenger class.
Survival by Gender: Plot survival rates by gender.
Survival by Age: Plot survival rates by age group.
Surviva by Embarked: Plot survival rates by port of embarkation.

Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between variables.
Use heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
Investigate pairwise relationships using scatter plots and pair plots.
Key Insights: Summarize key findings and insights from the EDA.

4. Interpretation and Reporting
Objective: Interpret the results of the EDA and summarize the findings.
Actions:
Key Findings: Highlight the main insights gained from the EDA.
Patterns and Trends: Discuss any notable patterns and trends in the data.
Relationships: Explain relationships between variables and their impact on survival rates.

Tools and Libraries:-
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Matplotlib: Plotting and visualization library.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library.

Conclusion:-
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in understanding complex datasets. By carefully cleaning the data and conducting thorough EDA, we can uncover valuable insights and tell compelling stories from raw data.
